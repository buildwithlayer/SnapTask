## 🎯 What is SnapTask?

SnapTask is an open-source tool that listens to your meetings (via audio upload or transcript) and automatically suggests well-scoped issues or comments in [Linear](https://linear.app).

It is built using the [Linear MCP](https://linear.app/docs/mcp) server, which allows it to be used with any Linear workspace.

It searches through your Linear workspace to find the best matching projects, teams, and users to create issues in.  It also looks for existing issues with similar titles and creates them if they don't exist.
